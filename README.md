# ShutdownWindows
A tiny GUI for the shutdown command in windows.

Time and again I leave my machine on to shutdown using the shutdown /s /t command in windows, but I can't be bothered to work out how many seconds in say, 4 hours.  So I made this tiny app to do the work for me.  It's super useful and small.

There is no malicious code in here but I accept no responsibility for any damanages this app may make to your machine.

## To Compile
Using *Visual Studio*, load the solution and click start.  You can publish the app from there too.

## Or Download Windows EXE
You can download the app from http://chud37.com/code/ShutdownWindows, in ZIP format.
